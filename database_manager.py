    """
    This class is used to write and read stuff with a database made out of local json files
    
    The files are being read from disk and turned into dicts.
    This class really shines with the context manager where you just ask for the name of a document and you
    can edit it as a dict.
    The dict is autometically written to disk when the context manager is closed.
    
    _save functions can be run on the class outside a context manager as they acquire the lock for the file.
    functions without save are only meant to be run inside a with statement that will lock the file for them.
    
    When reading you can call the static methods. 
    
    Database.read(name)
    
    It is not recommended to use the write methods use the context manager instead.
    When using the context manager make an instance of the class.
    
    with Database("document_name") as document:
        document_name["new_data"] = new_data
        
    Document will be a dict so you can use document as if it is a dict!
    
    If anything goes wrong with the context manager makes a rollback to the state before any edits is made!
